### :woman_technologist: About Me :  
I’ve been interested in computers all of my life – everything from building them to understanding how the parts work. My interest in computers has now grown into a passion for programming, inspiring me to take advantage of free online resources (e.g. FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy) in my free time to learn all things code. 

I am highly motivated to build a career in technology. I enrolled in Tech Elevators 14 week Java Development Bootcamp to further build upon the skills I've taught myself and gain professional experience in development.

I am focused on transitioning from the operations based roles I’ve held in the past, while continuing to leverage the skills I learned in those roles around process efficiencies and continuous improvement. With my 5 years of experience in labor, I’ve held a multitude of positions – everything from stocking shelves to managing a warehouse.

I'm currently searching for a Junior Developer role that will further help me mature my technical skill-set while also utilizing my diverse background to support and innovate the organization I’m working for. I also want to help educate and lead anyone looking to get into the tech field or just pick up a new side hobby.
